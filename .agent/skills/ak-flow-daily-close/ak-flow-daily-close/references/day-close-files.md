# AK-Flow daily close targets

Core files to update (do not rename):
- docs/PROCEDURES.md (read only; follow "Procedura Zamkniecia Dnia")
- docs/daily logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md
- docs/SYSTEM_MANIFEST.md
- docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md
- docs/engineering/CHALLENGES.md (only if new/resolved problem)
- ak-nexus/data/ak-flow-state.json
- docs/agi_tests.md (if P1.6 requested)

Prompts to ask the user if info is missing:
- "Did you rerun npm test / npm run build after the last commit?"
- "Any new or resolved challenge to record in CHALLENGES?"
- "Any manual UI checks performed today?"
