## Session

- AUTONOMIA v1: world vs artifact routing, new autonomy drives, desire/drive selection, tool feedback loop, tool energy costs.

## Summary

- Added world vs artifact routing heuristics with routing telemetry for read intents.
- Added autonomy actions (EXPLORE_WORLD/MEMORY/REFLECT/REST), desire computation, drive selection, and prompts.
- Added limbic feedback on tool results and centralized tool energy costs.
- Added/updated unit tests for routing, desires, drive selection, feedback, energy, and autonomy selection.

## Verification

- Tests: not rerun (new unit tests added).
- npm test: not rerun.
- npm run build: not rerun.
- Manual UI checks: not run.

## Next

- Run full test/build (and wiring checks if needed).
- Validate autonomy grounding for EXPLORE_WORLD/REFLECT/REST in a real session.
- Verify routing for verb-only read requests (e.g., "przeczytaj README") and adjust if needed.
