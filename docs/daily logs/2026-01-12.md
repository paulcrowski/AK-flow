## Session

- Routing WORLD/LIBRARY/ARTIFACT, tool contract enforcement, autonomy action override, library anchors.

## Summary

- Enforced TOOL_INTENT -> TOOL_RESULT/TOOL_ERROR contract, added path normalization with ambiguous path errors, and blocked unknown LIST_LIBRARY_CHUNKS tags.
- Added LIBRARY routing, artifact UUID recognition, and lastLibraryDocId anchor for "tam/te chunki"; autonomy override now maps autonomy actions to ActionType.
- Added chunk summary listing with honest count and a centralized memory injection listener for library reads.
- Added clamp in pickDrive plus new autonomy/routing/desires tests.

## Verification

- Tests: `npm test -- __tests__/unit/routingDecisionTelemetry.test.ts __tests__/unit/tools/toolParser.routing.test.ts`
- npm test: PASS (reported).
- npm run build: not rerun.
- Manual UI checks: not run.

## Next

- Run npm run build (and wiring checks if needed).
- Manual check: library read flow, "tam/te chunki", and artifact vs world routing in UI.
- Verify memory injection notes and autonomy override in real session logs.
