## Session

- P0 pending-action and Action-First hardening + pending module refactor.

## Summary

- Extracted PendingAction types/helpers/logic into pending/ module, wired store + runner sync, and reduced ReactiveStep.
- Hardened Action-First parsing: implicit references, append target guard, create filename sanitization, and payload prefix cleanup for pending synthetic commands.
- Improved JSON repair for truncated outputs (dangling key), added tests for implicit append/create and pending scenarios, plus small typing cleanup.

## Verification

- npx tsc --noEmit: PASS.
- npm test: PASS (665 tests, 1 skipped).
- npm run build: PASS (vite warnings about dynamic imports/chunk size).

## Next

- Implement READ_FILE + SEARCH_IN_REPO tools (P0).
- Work Loop v1 (Evidence-first cycle).
- Finish Serotonin Reactions mapping in ChemistryBridge.
