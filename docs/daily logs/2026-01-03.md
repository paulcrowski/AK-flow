## Session

- Telemetry fixes, faster large-doc ingest, document-level memory boosts, and autonomy micro JSON hardening.

## Summary

- Normalized token usage telemetry with canonical tokens_in/out/total fields, fallback mapping, and mismatch reporting plus tests.
- Added fast ingest mode for large docs: chunk pacing, active-learning limit, progress reporting, summary length targets, and cached summary reuse.
- Stored document-level DOCUMENT_INGESTED memories and boosted them on read/usage so chunk recall reinforces parent docs.
- Hardened autonomy V2 micro JSON with strict JSON-only prompts, retry path, and higher maxOutputTokens.

## Verification

- npm run test -- __tests__/integration/CortexInference.test.ts __tests__/unit/TokenUsageTelemetry.test.ts
- npm test: not rerun.
- npm run build: not rerun.
- Manual UI checks: not run.

## Next

- Run full test/build after latest commits.
- Validate TOKEN_USAGE aggregation and fast ingest timing on a large TXT.
- Continue P0 tools (READ_FILE/SEARCH_IN_REPO) and Work Loop v1.
