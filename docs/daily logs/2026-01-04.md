## Session

- Silicon Being v1 guardrails: file scan telemetry, evidence fallback, and intention-aware action selection.

## Summary

- Added file scan telemetry (summary/limit) with evidence-gate fallback and scan-limited bypass to avoid silent stalls.
- Wired intention into ActionSelector and weighted drive selection by belief priority; normalized ghost APIs via real usage.
- Added placeholder telemetry for lesson-goal creation plus scan-limit, truncation, and intention tests.

## Verification

- npx vitest run __tests__/unit/core/EventLoop.test.ts __tests__/unit/core/SiliconBeing.test.ts
- npm test: not rerun.
- npm run build: not rerun.
- Manual UI checks: not run.

## Next

- Run full test/build on latest Silicon Being changes.
- Validate scan-limit fallback + messaging in a real session.
- Continue P0 tools (READ_FILE/SEARCH_IN_REPO) and Work Loop v1.
